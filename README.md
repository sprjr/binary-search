# binary-search

Do not use, unless you are me. In which case use at your own risk, Stephen. If you're looking for a decent binary search, you might want to check out [binary-search](https://www.npmjs.com/package/binary-search).

They've added a few more features and safeguards for edge cases. For example,
things that help cover this [decades old bug](https://ai.googleblog.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html).

This library (and really anything I'll be publishing going forward) are just
for me to learn and have on hand. Typically, you don't _have_ to rebuild things
from the ground up. But! That doesn't mean you can't for fun or to understand
them better.
